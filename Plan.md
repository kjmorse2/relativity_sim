# I'm in way too deep, lets try:
## This is a sort of plan on how to approach this

### Start: Models: 
- points: 
  - positions 
  - velocities, \
  - age---------- both influenced by gravity. 
- Universe: 
  - Has 2 coordinates, describes the location of elements. 
- Gravity sources: 
  - positions
  - velocities
  - mass, affects range of influence. 
- STRETCH: Wormholes
  - 2 positions, that are linked together
  - size
  - velocity? Dont get to crazy.
